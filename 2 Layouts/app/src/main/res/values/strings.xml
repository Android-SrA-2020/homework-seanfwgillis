    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Sean.
\n\nI am the son of former Canadian diplomat(father) and a dentist for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa(mother).
\n\nI live for my partner, and my daughter.
\nThough, traditionally, I am avid weight lifter and runner, though college has made me incredibly lazy and out of shape.
\n\nThis is further compounded by eating enough food to feed a small african tribe.
\nI have a real passion for the craft of software and web development, yet question daily if I have the apptitude to succeed in this field.
\nHowever, I am not completely disheartened because I feel I could carve out a roll for myself in the field, yet maybe not as a pure dev.
\n\nI have predisposition of seeing the best in everyone, and am empathetic to a fault.
\n\nI also love curvy women.
\nMy partner is curvy, and god-damn she is sexy to me.\n\n</string>
